# Connecting to a server

Once `Atsumeru` is running, `REST API` can be accessed from applications by `http://<ip/server address>:<port>`

:::c-tip
When running server locally (for example, when connecting to server from device on which it is running), `<ip/server address>` will be `localhost`

Default `<port>` is `31337`
