Installing `Atsumeru` is very simple and consists of a couple steps

### Main installation methods

- Using `Java` and [Jar](./jar.md) server file
- Using [Docker](./docker.md) container with `Docker` or `Docker Compose`

### Additional required applications

Since the server does not provide a WebUI to manage the server, you must additionally download [Atsumeru Manager](https://github.com/AtsumeruDev/AtsumeruManager) <img style="position: relative; top: 6px;" width="24" height="24" src="/assets/media/icons/windows.png"> <img style="position: relative; top: 6px;" width="24" height="24" src="/assets/media/icons/penguin.png"> <img style="position: relative; top: 6px;" width="24" height="24" src="/assets/media/icons/apple.png">, through which management will take place

The application does not require installation, but it does require you to have [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=26999) and [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=53840) installed on Windows systems
